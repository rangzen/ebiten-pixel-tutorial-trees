# Rewriting the trees tutorial of Pixel with Ebiten for API comparison

I tried Pixel and really liked the clean API but the dev seems to be on pause [since late 2017](https://github.com/faiface/pixel/graphs/contributors).
Ebiten, on the other hand, is in full dev by the impressive [Hajime Hoshi](https://github.com/hajimehoshi)
and I used it for my test on the implementation of [boids in Go](https://github.com/rangzen/go-ebiten-boids).

This project is my attempt to rewrite the trees tutorial with the Ebiten API.

Iâ€™m not really satisfied with the result :( It looks cleaner with Pixel.
